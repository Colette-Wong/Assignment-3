    <div> <b>"We can onlt see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done."</b><br>Alan Mathison Turing was an English mathesmatician, computer scientist, logician cryptanalyst, philospher, and theoretical biologist. <br><br> He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. <br><br> Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime due to prevalence of homophobia at the time and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.</div>

   <ul>
     <li>During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Governmenet Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Part, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence.</li>
     <br>
     <li>For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.</li>
     <br>
     <li>Turing playeda crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enables the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.</li>
     <br>
     <li>After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine.</li>
     <br>
     <li>In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machines Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology</li>
     <br>
     <li>In 1960s, he wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis andpredicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction</li>
     <li>In 1952, Turing was prosecuted for homosecual acts</li>
     <br>
     <li>Turing died in 1953, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.</li>
     <br>
     <li>In 2009, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an offcial public apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated".</li>
     <br>
     <li> In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon</li>
     <br>
     <li>The 'Alan Turing law' is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.</li>
