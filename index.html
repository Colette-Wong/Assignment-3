    <div> <b>"We know the past but cannot control it. We control the future but cannot know it."</b><br>Claude Elwood Shannon was an American mathematician, electrical engineer, and cryptographer known as "the father of information theory."<br><br>Shannon is noted for having founded information theory with a landmark paper, "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", which he published in 1948.<br><br>He is also well known for founding digital circuit design theory in 1937, when—as a 21-year-old master's degree student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology—he wrote his thesis demonstraiting that electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical numerical relationship.</div>

   <ul>
     <li>1916: Born in a hosipital in nearby Petoskey</li>
    <li>1932: Graduated from Gaylord High School. Shannon showed an inclination towards mechanical and electrical things.</li>
    <br>
    <li>1932: Shannon entered the University of Michigan</li>
    <br>
    <li>1936: He graduated with two bachelor's degrees: one in electrical engineering and the other in mathematics</li>
    <br>
    <li>1936: Shannon began his graduate studies in electrical engineering at MIT, where he worked on Vannevar Bush's Differential analyzer, Shannon designed switching citcuits based on Boole's concepts.</li>
    <br<
    <li>1937: He wrote his master's degree thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits.</li>
    <br>
    <li>1938: A paper from this thesis was published</li>
    <br>
    <li>1940: Shannon received his PhD from MIT.</li>
    <br>
    <li>1940: Shannon became a National Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced STudy in Princeton, New Jerser. In Princeton, Shannon has the opportunity to dicuss his ideas with  influential scientists and mathematicians such as Hermann Weyl and JOn von Neumann, and he also had occasional encounters with Albert Enstein and Kurt Gödel.</li>
    <br>
    <li> Shannon worked freely across disciplines, and this ability may have contributed to his later development of mathematical information theory.</li>
